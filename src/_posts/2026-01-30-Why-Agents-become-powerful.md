description: "Why AI agents become powerful once they can control tools, not just reason."
---

AI agents only became truly useful once they were allowed to *do things*.

Reasoning alone isn’t enough.  
The real breakthrough happened when agents gained access to tools:
terminals, test runners, browsers, and APIs.

Once agents can:
- run code
- validate outputs
- search documentation
- interact with real systems  

they stop being chatbots and start becoming collaborators.

This post explores why tool-enabled agents change how we build software—and
where this approach still breaks down.
